        Task: Generate a list of unique quiz questions based on the specified topic and number of questions.

        This method orchestrates the quiz generation process by utilizing the `generate_question_with_vectorstore`
        method to generate each question and the `validate_question` method to ensure its uniqueness before adding it
        to the quiz.

        Steps:
            1. Initialize an empty list to store the unique quiz questions.
            2. Loop through the desired number of questions (`num_questions`), generating each question via
            `generate_question_with_vectorstore`.
            3. For each generated question, validate its uniqueness using `validate_question`.
            4. If the question is unique, add it to the quiz; if not, attempt to generate a new question (consider
            implementing a retry limit).
            5. Return the compiled list of unique quiz questions.

        Returns:
        - A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a unique quiz question generated based on the topic.

        Note: This method relies on `generate_question_with_vectorstore` for question generation and `validate_question`
        for ensuring question uniqueness. Ensure `question_bank` is properly initialized and managed.

        added to the quiz.

        Steps:
            1. Extract the question text from the provided dictionary.
